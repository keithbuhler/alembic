My epistemology strives, so far as possible given time constraints, to be what I call "case-by-case": that is, I don't judge all "weird" views (bigfoot, fairies, UFOs, ghosts, demons) in one swoop, but consider each one case by case. 

Nor do I judge all "official" views (western science, religious monotheism, political democracy) in one swoop, but try to patiently examine them one by one. 

In other words, my Overton Window is enormous. The "unthinkable" sectors are narrow slices at each extreme.  I consider almost all views to be possible alternatives to present policy; the new and radical view just needs an argument, and I'll be convinced. 

This is not to say that I constantly feel vulnerable to being persuaded of wild and strange beliefs. The radical view needs to withstand criticism as well.

Nor is it to say that my views are undetermined: I am a church-going Christian with a rather optimistic rationalist epistemology. I'm a Platonic realist in metaphysics, a moral realist in metaethics, and a pretty traditional defender of monogamy, love, virtue, self-sacrifice, generational respect, care for oneself, one's children and parents, and the world. 

That said, I take atheism seriously. And pantheism. 

I take ethical egoism seriously. And moral nihilism.  

I take the politically progressive or so-called culturally Marxist ideology seriously.  And anarchism. And monarchy. 

That is not to say I'm confused. Rather, I try to remain willing to hear out both (or multiple) sides of an issue and take it case-by-case. As I read him, that willingness is how Plato's Socrates lived. 


### Benefits


![aristotle rembrandt](http://www.energyenhancement.org/Rembrandt-Aristotle-contemplating-bust-Homer.jpg)

The major benefit of this approach is relational: when I converse with people with "strange" views in class or in church or the proverbial water cooler, I enjoy the discourse and try to learn something, and criticize their views charitably. (They usually find my arguments delightful, if exotic, as well.)

In the last five years, I have come across (just in class or work) conspiracy theorists, flat earthers, Tarot card readers, anarchists, alt-right, Russian Orthodox Christians, scientific atheists, Nietzschean nihilists, a person who lives in a haunted hous, prophets and miracle workers, religious nuns, religious "Nones", and others. 

With each person, I strive to _really dialogue_. Strive to listen and talk, to take their thoughts seriously, to disagree without condescension, and generally to have a roaring good time.

And I don't let myself write off and dismiss their views in conversation simply because I don't trust the source (which is oftentimes a genetic fallacy) or because they are "weird" to me (which is often the fallacy of personal incredulity). 

A second benefit is intellectual: I have learned a lot and had to think a lot harder about my metaphysics and epistemology. Why, for example, if I take eye-witness testimony to be authoritative in most cases, do I believe X when he reports A but not Y when he reports B -- even of both are non-experts but personal friends whom I trust? 

If universals are not real, then why do arguments for nominalism assume realism in the very form of the language? 

How do you disprove that a conspiracy has occurred? (My argument is that people are tremendously bad at keeping secrets; so any conspiracy that requires the intimate knowledge of more than 3-5 people, by my hypothesis, would become publicly known.) 

To be sure, many conspiracy theorists suffer from sorely bad reasoning. They affirm conjecture when agnosticism would do just fine. But I still debate them (for at time!).  And if their bad arguments challenge me to come up with good arguments, it's not a waste of time to debate. It's like swinging a bat with weights on it -- it's "unnecessary" work, but has a payoff.

A third benefit is moral: I have to cultivate and exercise virtues such as charity, the benefit of the doubt, and undying patience. The dialectic grinds slowly, but it grinds effectively. 


### Downsides

![pulling a fish from a lake](https://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/367/367images/tobiasangel.jpg)

The first drawback of case-by-case epistemology is that it takes a lot of time. It is much quicker to categorize views according to "families" and develop a well-reasoned position about all "theisms" or all "atheisms" all at once. 

It's not that I go out of my way to research radical views all the time, but I do come across people who hold radical views. And each one gets a full and hopefully fair hearing -- which takes time. 

A second downside is that people think _I_ hold the weird views I'm just entertaining. For example, I had an argument with a close friend about the "alt-right" this last election cycle. I am not alt-right, and am not sure what the phrase even means, but I was trying not to dismiss those who identify that way with simple epithets. He assumed my refusal to disavow them amounted to an endorsement. 

I wrote my whole dissertation entertaining ethical naturalism, not because I already believed it, but because I needed to give it a fair hearing. That takes time. (And I did become convinced of ethical naturalism, though an idiosyncratic form defended by Philippa Foot.) 

The point is, while in the middle of a hearing, people might think you agree with the plaintiff. 

A hearing takes more time than a sneering. Chesterton says (in _Dumb Ox_) of Thomas Aquinas that he refused to sneer: 

>"It is generally the man who is not ready to argue, who is ready to sneer. That is why, in recent literature, there has been so little argument and so much sneering."


He says few people have enough time to argue fairly: 

>There is always time to argue unfairly; not least in a time like ours.  Being himself resolved to argue, to argue honestly, to answer everybody, to deal with everything, [Aquinas] produced books enough to sink a ship or stock a library. 


A third downside is that I don't get to feel arrogant. I don't automatically presume that I'm the intellectual superior to everyone who disagrees with me. I don't presume that you're either stupid-and-wrong or intelligent-and-right but assume that some people are intelligent-but-wrong.

It's a big loss, because it's fun to feel superior. But so it goes. 

Are there any other downsides I'm missing?
